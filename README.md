# YOLOv11s Object Detection Experiment (WIP)

A small sub-project exploring object detection using YOLOv11s, aligned with my larger computer vision project on space imagery and object tracking.

This project is focused on experimenting with modern detection models, understanding training pipelines, and learning how data size and quality impact model performance.


## Project Goals

Train a YOLOv11s model on a custom dataset (~140 images)

Detect various objects and draw bounding boxes

Learn the end-to-end object detection workflow

Understand limitations of small datasets and improve iteratively



## Current Progress

Model successfully detects objects and draws bounding boxes

Bounding boxes are inconsistent due to small dataset

Early-stage experiment demonstrates proof-of-concept success

This project highlights that even limited datasets can produce working models, but scaling data is critical for reliable performance.

## Tech Stack

Python

PyTorch / YOLOv11s

OpenCV for preprocessing & visualization

Matplotlib for visualizing results


## Dataset Notice
The dataset used for training contains personal household images and is not included in this repository for privacy reasons.
Folder structure, training configuration, and evaluation results are preserved to demonstrate the full object detection pipeline.
